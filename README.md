# SMARTLIFT: Intelligent Workout Tracker
1. Introduction
In recent years, fitness tracking has become a trend among individuals who are invested in their physical health and well-being. Using wearable devices, users can track various metrics like heart rate, steps, calories burned, and more. However, strength training, especially barbell exercises, remains under-explored in these trackers. This project aims to create a fitness tracker that leverages machine learning to classify barbell exercises and count repetitions using data collected from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.
2. Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to build a Python-based fitness tracker capable of classifying barbell exercises and counting repetitions. This will be achieved using accelerometer and gyroscope data collected via the Meta Motion sensor. The exercises we aim to classify are:
•	Bench Press
•	Deadlift
•	Overhead Press
•	Barbell Row
•	Squats
3. Data Collection
The data for this project was collected during gym workouts using the Meta Motion sensor, a research-grade device by Ambient Lab. It tracks various sensor values and exports them into CSV files, which we will use to process and train our machine learning model. Five participants, including myself, performed each exercise with the sensor attached to their wrists, which generated unique time-series patterns.
4. Quantified Self
The concept of the Quantified Self is central to this project. It refers to individuals who engage in self-tracking of biological, physical, behavioral, or environmental information to achieve a personal goal. Devices like Apple Watches and Whoop Bands track metrics such as heart rate and sleep, empowering users to optimize their health. This fitness tracker will expand the Quantified Self's capabilities into strength training.
5. Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries will be used:
•	Visual Studio Code with interactive Python
•	Python Libraries:
•	Pandas for data processing
•	Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
•	Scikit-learn for machine learning models
•	NumPy for numerical operations
6. Project Workflow
The development of the fitness tracker will be divided into several key stages:
6.1 Data Processing
In this stage, we will read and clean the CSV files containing the raw accelerometer and gyroscope data using the Pandas library. We'll handle missing values, remove irrelevant data, and split the data into training and test sets.
6.2 Data Visualization
To understand the patterns of each exercise, we will visualize the time-series data. Graphing the data using Python's Matplotlib or Seaborn libraries will help reveal distinct patterns for each exercise, which are essential for classification.
6.3 Outlier Detection
Sensor data is often noisy due to extraneous movements. We'll detect and eliminate outliers using methods like Z-score or IQR. This process ensures that only valid exercise data is considered for training the model.
6.4 Feature Engineering
This step involves extracting useful features from the raw sensor data. We'll extract features such as:
•	Statistical features (mean, variance)
•	Frequency domain features
•	Time-based features
•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
•	Low-pass filtering to smooth noisy signals
6.5 Predictive Modeling
We'll build and evaluate various classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks) to identify the best model for classifying the exercises. The model will take time-series data as input and output the predicted exercise type.
6.6 Repetition Counting
Finally, we will implement an algorithm to count exercise repetitions. By identifying the cyclical patterns in the sensor data, the algorithm can accurately track how many repetitions of each exercise were performed.
7. Challenges and Solutions
•	Noisy Data: One challenge with sensor data is the presence of noise from unintentional movements. We will handle this through outlier detection and filtering techniques.
•	Real-Time Classification: While this project focuses on analyzing pre-collected data, expanding it to real-time classification using mobile devices and wearable sensors is a future possibility.
8. Future Directions
In the future, we can expand the fitness tracker to:
•	Include more exercises (e.g., lunges, curls)
•	Develop real-time tracking on a mobile app
•	Integrate with popular fitness devices (Apple Watch, Fitbit)
9. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in enhancing fitness tracking, specifically for strength training. By processing and analyzing sensor data, we can accurately classify exercises and count repetitions, paving the way for more automated and personalized workout tracking solutions.
